# book-mngmt
This is a pet project of mine using C++ and MySQL to manage (find, add, remove) a list of books.
Firstly, I connect the program with MySQL by MySQL C++ Connector. Link: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-cpp/1.1/en/ .
Then I design 2 classes named Book and ListBook inheriting a list of Book type. Never reveal the password in the code but this is for learning purposes only.
